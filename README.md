# DiceRollingGame

A program in which you and the computer roll and re-roll three dice to compete for the highest score.

You and the computer should take turns rolling three dice, with possible values of 1 through 6. After each roll, the scores of both the computer and the user are saved. The game ends when one player rolls three matching dice. For example, one player rolls three dice each having the value of 4. Give a 10-point bonus to the player who rolled the three matching dice to end the game. Tally up the score at the end of the game. The player with the highest score wins. Display the final score and the winner.
